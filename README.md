# Housing Data Analysis and Clustering

## Project Overview

This project delves into a comprehensive dataset of housing information, aiming to uncover patterns and insights through rigorous data preparation, analysis, and clustering techniques. We utilize K-Means clustering, implemented via PyTorch, to segment geographical locations based on a multitude of housing features, providing a nuanced understanding of the data.

## Features and Data Preparation

The dataset encompasses a variety of features, including:

- Geographic coordinates (longitude, latitude)
- Median age of houses
- Total number of rooms and bedrooms
- Population and household counts
- Median income
- Median house value
- Proximity to the ocean

Data preparation steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data to facilitate optimal clustering outcomes.

## Clustering with K-Means

Leveraging PyTorch, we apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to categorize the dataset into distinct groups. This segmentation reveals areas with similar housing attributes, serving as a foundation for real estate market analysis, urban planning, and investment strategies.
